# 🎯 Day 1: Number Guessing Game

## 📖 Project Description
Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game!**  
In this fun beginner-level project, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100,  
and your task is to guess it correctly.  
The program gives you hints — “Too high!” or “Too low!” — until you find the right number.  

This project helped me practice **loops, conditionals, and random number generation** in Python.


## 🧠 Concepts & Skills Learned
✅ "random" module for generating random numbers  
✅ "while" loop for continuous guessing  
✅ "if–elif–else" statements for logical decisions  
✅ "input()" and "print()" functions for interaction  
✅ Counting user attempts with variables  


## 💻 How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Download or clone this project folder.  
3. Open the file in your terminal or code editor and run: python number_guessing_game.py
4.Start guessing and have fun! 🎮


🟨 Sample Output
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 33
Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 attempts!


🚀 Future Improvements
Add a maximum number of attempts to make it more challenging
Allow the user to choose a custom number range
Save high scores to a file for tracking performance
